3D AI Search Algorithms Simulation

Overview

This project is a 3D simulation designed to visualize and compare the behavior of several classical AI search algorithms. It provides an interactive environment where users can observe how different algorithms traverse a search space to find the optimal path from a start point to a goal.
The project is implemented in TypeScript and leverages 3D graphics to make the learning experience more intuitive and engaging.

Algorithms Implemented

The following search algorithms are included in this simulation:
A* (A-Star) – Finds the shortest path using heuristics.
DFS (Depth-First Search) – Explores as far as possible along each branch.
BFS (Breadth-First Search) – Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving deeper.
UCS (Uniform Cost Search) – Finds the least-cost path in a weighted graph.
IDS (Iterative Deepening Search) – Combines the depth-limited approach with iterative deepening.

Features

Interactive 3D visualization of the search process.
Real-time updates showing the exploration and path selection of each algorithm.
Customizable start and goal positions.
Adjustable obstacles and search space size for testing different scenarios.
Step-by-step algorithm simulation mode for educational purposes
